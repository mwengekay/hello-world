Hi Humans!

My name is kay and i am a petroleum engineer by trade, i currently work for a oil field service company and have been for the past two two  years. its long hours and mentally draining at times but i would say i enjoy it. in may spare time i like to go to the gym, play sports and learn how to play electric Guitar.
